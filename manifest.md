   - Allow users to modify the shopping list and mark items as purchased.

6. **User Interface:**
   - Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Implement responsive web design to ensure the application works well on various devices.

**Steps and Files Required:**
1. **Project Proposal (Google Document):**
   - This document will outline the project's purpose, objectives, features, and the technologies to be used.

2. **MVP Definition:**
   - Identify the core features required for the Minimum Viable Product, focusing on recipe addition, search, and meal planning.

3. **Trello Board:**
   - Create a Trello board to track tasks and progress during the development phase.

4. **Frontend:**
   - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to design and implement the user interface.
   - JavaScript for handling user interactions and managing recipe data.

5. **Backend:**
   - Python or JavaScript (Node.js) to create a backend server for user authentication and recipe data storage.

6. **Database:**
   - Utilize a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB) to store recipe and user data.

7. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user registration and login functionality using Python, JavaScript, or a suitable library (e.g., Flask, Express, Django).
